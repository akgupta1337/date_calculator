# Date Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Date Calculator** repository! This simple Python script allows you to calculate the total number of days between two given dates without importing any external libraries.

## How It Works

The `date_calculator.py` script takes two dates as input and computes the total number of days between them. The calculation includes both the start and end dates.

## Usage

To use the Date Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `date_calculator.py` file.
2. Modify the `start_date` and `end_date` variables with your desired dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. Run the script.

```bash
python date_calculator.py
